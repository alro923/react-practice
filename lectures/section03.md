## React ?
- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- HTML, CSS & JavaScript are about building user interfaces as well
- React makes building complex, interactive and reactive user interfaces simpler

- React is all about "Components"

## What is components?

- Because, all user interfaces in the end are made up of components
  - Components : reusable bulding blocks in your user interface
  - combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript (don't have to re-make it)
  - individual buldingblocks which we combine together to build a user interface
  - All user interfaces on all kinds of web applications can be split up into components.


## Why components?
  - Reusability : Don't repeart yourself
  - Separation of concerns : Don't do too many things in one and the same place (function), keeping our code small and manageable
  - -> Split big chunks of code into multiple smaller functions

## How is a component built?
  - In the end user interfaces are about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
  - And therefor all these components are about combining HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

- React is all about components and about building these components which we combined together.

- React uses something which is called a declarative approach for building these components.
- And you will see what exactly that is, but it basically means that with React, you will not tell React that a certain HTML element should be created and inserted in a specific place on the user interface as you would be doing it with Vanilla JavaScript, so with just JavaScript, for example.
- Instead with React and that's really important, you will always define the desired end state, the target state or possibly also different target states depending on different conditions and it's then React's job to figure out which elements on the actual webpage might need to be added or removed or updated.
- And you don't write these concrete DOM updating instructions on your own as you would be doing it with just JavaScript, instead with React and React components, you just define these end states and under which conditions which state should be used and then React will do all of the rest under the hood.
